## About the Work

We study the synchronization of a superconducting qubit to an external optical field via a mechanical resonator in a hybrid electrooptomechanical system.
The quantum trajectory method is employed to investigate synchronization.
The bistability in one of the qubit polarization vectors, where the qubit rotates about the polarization vector, is observed for a single quantum trajectory run.
The rotation in one of the stable states is synced with the external optical drive.
When the number of trajectories is significantly increased, the qubit no longer displays bistability.
However, synchronization with less quantum fluctuations is still observed.
The scheme could be used to prepare and monitor the state of the microwave qubit to a long-lived optical photon through synchronization, which may find applications in long-distance quantum communication.
Also, this hybrid system can be used to study quantum synchronization.

Here, `bar` represents the version.

*Note:* Some data files have been excluded from this repository to fit GitHub's storage limits without using Git LFS services.
These data files can also be generated by running their corresponding scripts.

## Installing Dependencies

All numerical values are calculated using [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip), a Python framework for the dynamics of open quantum systems.
Refer to the [QuTiP documentation](https://qutip.org/downloads/4.7.3/qutip-doc-4.7.pdf) for the steps to install this library.

All plots are obtained using the [Quantum Optomechanics Toolbox](https://github.com/sampreet/qom), an open-source Python framework to simulate optomechanical systems.
Refer to the [QOM toolbox documentation](https://sampreet.github.io/qom-docs/v1.0.1) for the steps to install this libary.

## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, navigate *inside* the top-level directory, and execute:

```bash
python scripts/bar/baz.py
```

Here, `bar` is the name of the folder (containing the version information) inside `scripts` and `baz.py` is the name of the script (refer to the repository structure).
